### Simple. Pluggable. Reliable. Extensible. Scalable.
A powerful background job processing library for Clojure. Goose is named after [LT Nick 'Goose' Bradshaw](https://topgun.fandom.com/wiki/Nick_Bradshaw), the _sidekick_ to [Captain Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell](https://topgun.fandom.com/wiki/Pete_Mitchell) in Top Gun.

Announcement ðŸ”ˆ
---------
We are excited to announce that **five companies** are successfully and reliably using Goose in production environments. With the release of a [Jobs Management Console](https://github.com/nilenso/goose/wiki/Console), Goose has reached a level of maturity, offering a feature-rich, stable, and production-ready background job processing solution.

As we continue addressing user feedback, we are *rescheduling* the **1.0.0 release to February 1st, 2026**. In the meantime, we will ensure API stability, backward compatibility and zero-downtime upgrades.

We welcome feedback from current and new users, especially if youâ€™d like to request features or suggest changes to the API or implementation before the 1.0.0 release. Please review our [Architecture Decisions](https://github.com/nilenso/goose/tree/main/architecture-decisions) and [Wiki](https://github.com/nilenso/goose/wiki) for more context, and share your thoughts via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nilenso/goose/issues/new) or the [Clojurians Slack](https://clojurians.slack.com/channels/goose).

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/com.nilenso/goose.svg?labelColor=283C67&color=729AD1&style=for-the-badge&logo=clojure&logoColor=fff)](https://clojars.org/com.nilenso/goose)

### Add Goose as a dependency
```Clojure
;;; Clojure CLI/deps.edn
com.nilenso/goose {:mvn/version "0.6.0"}

;;; Leiningen/Boot
[com.nilenso/goose "0.6.0"]
```

### Client
```Clojure
(ns my-app
  (:require
    [goose.brokers.rmq.broker :as rmq]
    [goose.client :as c]))

(defn my-fn
  [arg1 arg2]
  (println "my-fn called with" arg1 arg2))

(let [rmq-producer (rmq/new-producer rmq/default-opts)
      ;; Along with RabbitMQ, Goose supports Redis as well.
      client-opts (assoc c/default-opts :broker rmq-producer)]
  ;; Supply a fully-qualified function symbol for enqueuing.
  ;; Args to perform-async are variadic.
  (c/perform-async client-opts `my-fn "foo" :bar)
  (c/perform-in-sec client-opts 900 `my-fn "foo" :bar)
  ;; When shutting down client...
  (rmq/close rmq-producer))
```

### Worker
```Clojure
(ns my-worker
  (:require
    [goose.brokers.rmq.broker :as rmq]
    [goose.worker :as w]))

;;; 'my-app' namespace should be resolvable by worker.
(let [rmq-consumer (rmq/new-consumer rmq/default-opts)
      ;; Along with RabbitMQ, Goose supports Redis as well.
      worker-opts (assoc w/default-opts :broker rmq-consumer)
      worker (w/start worker-opts)]
  ;; When shutting down worker...
  (w/stop worker) ; Performs a graceful shutsdown.
  (rmq/close rmq-consumer))
```
