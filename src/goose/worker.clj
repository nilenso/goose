  #### Mandatory Keys
  `:broker`                : Message broker that transfers message from Producer to Consumer.\\
  Given value must implement [[goose.broker/Broker]] protocol.\\
  [Message Broker wiki](https://github.com/nilenso/goose/wiki/Message-Brokers)

  `:threads`               : Count of thread-pool-size for executing jobs.

  `:queue`                 : Queue from which to consume jobs for execution.

  `:graceful-shutdown-sec` : Waiting time for in-progress jobs to complete during shutdown.

  `:metrics-plugin`        : Publish Goose metrics to respective backend.\\
  Example                  : [[statsd/StatsD]]\\
  Given value must implement [[goose.metrics/Metrics]] protocol.

  #### Optional Keys
  `:middlewares`          : Chain of function/s to run 'around' execution of a Job
  [Middlewares wiki](https://github.com/nilenso/goose/wiki/Middlewares)

  `:error-service-config` : Config for error service like Honeybadger, Sentry, etc.\\

(defn start
  "Starts a worker process that does multiple things including, but not limited to:
  - Consuming & execution of jobs from given queue
  - Enqueuing scheduled jobs due for execution
  - Retry failed jobs & mark them as dead when retries are exhausted
  - Send metrics around Job execution & state of message broker
